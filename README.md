# Real-Time-ETL-Pipeline
Building a real-time ETL pipeline for data ingestion and transformation
Real-time ETL Pipeline with API Connectivity and Monitoring
Project Overview
This project is focused on designing and implementing a real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. The pipeline automates data ingestion from REST APIs and static files (e.g., CSV), performs data transformation, and loads the processed data into a database for storage and analysis. Key features include error monitoring, alerting mechanisms, and a scalable design to handle large datasets.

The goal is to simulate a real-world data engineering scenario, showcasing end-to-end data pipeline management and troubleshooting capabilities.

Key Features
Automated Data Ingestion:

Fetch data from REST APIs (e.g., stock or weather data) and static files like CSV.
Schedule data ingestion jobs for real-time updates.
Data Transformation:

Clean and standardize raw data using Python libraries like pandas and NumPy.
Handle missing values and ensure data consistency before loading.
Data Loading:

Store processed data in a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.
Optimize database storage using indexing and schema design.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Implement logging for pipeline activity and error tracking.
Integrate Slack API or email notifications to alert failures or delays.
Scalable Design:

Ensure the pipeline can adapt to increasing data volume and diverse data sources.

Architecture
Data Flow
Data Ingestion:

Fetch raw data from REST APIs and static files.
Validate and log successful retrieval or errors.
Data Transformation:

Standardize column names, formats, and handle missing data.
Apply transformations like aggregations or normalization.
Data Loading:

Insert transformed data into a PostgreSQL database.
Maintain a scalable schema for efficient querying.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Log all stages of the pipeline.
Notify via Slack/email for errors or anomalies.
Project Goals
Reliability:
Ensure pipeline robustness with comprehensive error handling and logging.
Scalability:
Design the pipeline to handle increasing data volume and new data sources seamlessly.
Insight-Driven:
Provide ready-to-use data for downstream analytics and decision-making.
Real-Time Monitoring:
Build an alert system to minimize downtime and data quality issues.
