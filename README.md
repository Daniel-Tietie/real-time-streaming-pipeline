# Real-Time Data Pipeline for Streaming Analytics

## 📋 Overview
This ongoing project focuses on building a scalable, real-time data processing system that handles streaming data efficiently. The pipeline leverages modern distributed systems architecture to process, analyze, and store high-volume data streams for immediate insights and historical analysis.

## 🚀 Current Features
- **Event Streaming**: Processing continuous data flows using Apache Kafka
- **Distributed Computing**: Implementing parallel data processing with PySpark
- **Workflow Automation**: Managing data orchestration with Apache Airflow
- **Cloud Data Warehouse**: Building analytics infrastructure with Snowflake
- **Data Quality Framework**: Ensuring accuracy and reliability through automated testing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Streaming**: Apache Kafka
- **Processing**: PySpark
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow
- **Storage**: Snowflake
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Version Control**: Git

## 🔄 Pipeline Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion**: Capture streaming events through Kafka producers
2. **Stream Processing**: Transform and enrich data in real-time with PySpark
3. **Workflow Management**: Coordinate pipeline tasks with Airflow DAGs
4. **Data Storage**: Load processed data into Snowflake for analytics
5. **Quality Assurance**: Monitor data quality with automated testing frameworks
